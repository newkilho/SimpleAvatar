Add a simple avatar upload field to user profiles for custom profile pictures, with automatic resizing and real-time updates.

== Description ==

Custom Profile Picture Upload: Users can upload their own avatars directly from the frontend or the "Edit Profile" screen, allowing for a personalized profile picture experience.
Automatic Thumbnail Generation: When users upload a new avatar, the plugin automatically generates resized images (thumbnails) for optimal display in different contexts.
Real-Time Avatar Update: The plugin provides a smooth and intuitive user experience by allowing users to preview their avatar changes instantly, without having to refresh the page.
Simple File Handling: Supports JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats, ensuring compatibility with common image types.
Fully Integrated with WordPress User Profiles: The custom avatar replaces the default Gravatar for each user, while still keeping Gravatar as a fallback if no custom avatar is uploaded.
Clean and Lightweight: Kilho's Simple Avatar focuses on simplicity and efficiency, ensuring minimal impact on your site's performance.
This plugin is perfect for websites looking to provide users with more control over their profile customization, while keeping the interface simple and responsive.
